# Creational pattern -> Factory Method
Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying thier concrete classes.
Factory method defines a methos, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can overrride this method to change the class of objects that will be created.

It is very useful when you need to provide a high level of flexibility for your code.
